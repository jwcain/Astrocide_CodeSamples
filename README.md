Astrocide is a 2D side-view arcade shooter focused on bringing a retro-classic feel to some simple arcade games on the Nintendo Switch. I was hired in as an intern but was the only programmer on the team so I managed all of the software development.

My part of the project was only developed during my internship during the summer of 2018. The current state of the project is unknown to me.

With my employerâ€™s permission, I have included a small sampling of the code I wrote for the project. Within each of their sub-folders, you can find a more detailed description of the code.
